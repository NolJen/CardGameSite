        <p>
            Checks and Balances started off as an assignment for one of my classes in the spring of 2022. That version of the game: Had a different name, more complicated cards, used dice, used a counter, and overall was a less enjoyable game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now after months of playtesting and multiple ideations Checks and Balances is close to complete. Having plenty of cards to play with while also keeping each card simple, each game feels new but not overly complicated (like older versions). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Special thanks to all of the team's friends who took the time to test and critique the game so that anyone can enjoy it.
