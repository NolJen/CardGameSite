            Do you have what it takes to survive the shifting rules of Checks and Balances?
        </p>
        <p>
            ETHOS: A simple card game that can be played in quick rounds that is fun for both new and experienced players.
        </p>
        <p>
            Checks and Balances games are all about change. Starting with only a few basic rules, the game gradually becomes more intricate as additional TREATY cards are introduced. At first there will be no way to lose but that's where all the Treaties come into play. Each Treaty is different but when combined together you will have to follow or somehow go around them without being caught. But if you are caught violating a treaty you will be eliminated from the game. The last player standing wins.
