            Rules for Checks and Balances
        </h1>
        <h2 class="titleOfStuff">Overview:</h2>
        <dl>
            <dd class="smallertext">
                Checks and Balances games are all about change. Starting with only a few basic rules, the game gradually becomes more intricate as additional TREATY cards are introduced. At first there will be no way to lose but that's where all the Treaties come into play. Each Treaty is different but when combined together you will have to follow or somehow go around them without being caught. But if you are caught violating a treaty you will be eliminated from the game. The last player standing wins.

        <h2 class="titleOfStuff" >Setup:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li class="smallertext">
                Place the Basic Rules card in the center of the table. 
            </li>
            <li class="smallertext">
                Shuffle the deck and deal three cards to each player
            </li>
            <li class="smallertext">
                Establish the draw pile by placing the remainder of the deck face down where everyone can reach it.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="titleOfStuff">Types of Cards:</h2>
        <dl>
            <dd class="smallertext">Each turn you will draw at least one card, add it to your hand, and Play at least one card. Here is how each type of card is used in the game:
            </dd>
        </dl>
        
        <h4 class="titleOfStuff">Actions:</h4>
        <dl>
            <dd class="smallertext">
                Actions are single-use cards. Follow the instructions on the card, then discard it. 
            </dd>
            <dd class="smallertext">To play an Action card, do whatever it says, then place it on the discard pile.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h4 class="titleOfStuff">Treaty:</h4>
        <dl>
            <dd class="smallertext">
                Treaties change the way the game works. When a new Treaty is played, you must adapt to it right away. 
            </dd>
            <dd class="smallertext">
                 When a new Treaty contradicts with a Treaty card already in play, the old Treaty is discarded. Treaty cards take effect immediately.
            </dd>
            <dd class="smallertext">
                To play one, place it face up in the center of the table.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <h4 class="titleOfStuff">Veto:</h4>
        <dl>
            <dd class="smallertext">
                You can play a Veto card at any time before an action has begun, even if it's not your turn. A Veto can stop any action even other Vetos. 
            </dd>
            <dd>
                So you can play a Veto on another Veto to cancel the Veto out, and so on. Any cards that have been Vetoed are lost. Leave them in the Discard Pile.
            </dd>
            <dd class="smallertext">
                Veto cards take effect immediately. To play one, place it face up in the center of the table. 
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <h3 class="titleOfStuff">Limits:</h3>
        <dl>
            <dd class="smallertext">
                At first there will be no limitations on the number of cards you can hold in your hand. But some Treaty cards will create such restrictions. The new Treaties only affect you when itâ€™s NOT your turn. So you can ignore them until your turn ends. When someone plays a new Treaty that limits something, the other player must immediately comply with the new Treaty, discarding cards if needed. Otherwise they will be in violation and may be caught causing them to lose the game. 
            </dd>
